The intention of this project is to provide a C-reference manual that can
be viewed with Vim and accessed from within Vim. 
The C-reference is a reference, it is NOT a tutorial or a guide on how
to write C-programs. It is a quick reference to the functions and syntax 
of the standard C language.

There are several ways to specify a word CRefVim should search for in order
to view help:

  <Leader>cr normal mode:  get help for word under cursor
                           Memory aid cr: (c)-(r)eference
  <Leader>cr visual mode:  get help for visually selected text
                           Memory aid cr: (c)-(r)eference
  <Leader>cw:              prompt for word CRefVim should search for
                           Memory aid cw: (c)-reference (w)hat
  <Leader>cc:              jump to table of contents of the C-reference manual
                           Memory aid cc: (c)-reference (c)ontents

Note: by default <Leader> is \, e.g. press \cr to invoke C-reference

Note: The best way to search for an operator (++, --, %, ...) is to visually
select it and press <Leader>cr.

To get help do :help crefvimdoc
To show the C-reference manual do :help crefvim
